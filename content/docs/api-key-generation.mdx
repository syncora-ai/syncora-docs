### Step 2: Generate New Key

Click "Generate New API Key" and configure the following:

- Rate limits

### Step 3: Secure Storage

Store your API key securely and never share it publicly.

## Key Management

// Using API key in requests
const response = await fetch("/api/data", {
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
});
```
