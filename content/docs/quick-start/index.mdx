## Quick starts for Model creators and Data consumers

Model creators are the guardians of original data and own the training of new AI models that make data privacy-safe for further utility.

Data consumers, through Syncora, have easy access to synthetic data they can analyze, use for downstream machine learning (ML) tasks, and share freely, without the privacy concerns.
